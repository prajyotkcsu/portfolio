# Software Engineer
*Hi, I’m a backend engineer with 5 years of experience. My background in CS, passion for coding daily, and occasional technical blogging equip me to tackle complex problems with confidence.*

### Technical skills:
- I code in Java but also know Python, JS, and Go.
- I’m a Spring Boot enthusiast, which is a Java-based web framework.
- Skilled in building APIs with REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.
- Proficient in deploying software with Kubernetes, Docker, and GitLab.
- Experienced with Kafka, Flink, Spark, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch.
- Strong knowledge of AWS and Azure cloud platforms.

### Education:
- M.S. Business Analytics; California State University, East Bay (May 2023)
- B.S. Information Technology; Mumbai University (May 2017)

### Work Experience:
**Software Engineer @ Dish Network (March 2024 - Present)** <br>
I’m a developer on this epic team called ‘Events’  that handles communication on behalf of other teams. This involves receiving close to 10 million events and notifications in a single day and routing them to their respective targets. Following are some of my contributions,<br>
- Unified Deployment with Harness: We traditionally used GitLab for code deployment across repositories and CloudFormation for AWS-based software. As pipeline issues arose—code inconsistently deploying across environments and delayed approvals due to inaccessible files—we conducted R&D to find a better solution. This led to adopting Harness, unifying deployments on a single platform for better tracking and consistency.
-Scaling Event Processing to 5 Million Without Lambda Throttling: We scaled event processing from 1 million to 5 million without crashing AWS Lambda by introducing AWS SQS as a pseudo buffer between AWS EventBridge and Lambda. This effectively prevented Lambda throttling, enabling smooth and efficient scaling.
- API for Safe Event Stream Management: We designed an API to shut off the stream of events from specific sources flagged as unsafe, ensuring the rest of the workflow continued uninterrupted.
- Customizable Delays for Event Delivery: In scenarios requiring delayed event delivery (e.g., 15, 25, or 45 minutes), we developed an endpoint that accepts a customizable delay value. AWS Scheduled Events were used to manage these delays with precision.
