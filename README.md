# Software Engineer
*Hi, I’m a backend engineer with close to 5 years of experience. My formal education in computer science, dedication to daily coding practice, and passion for writing technical blogs equip me to tackle challenges head-on and continually grow as an engineer.*

### What technologies I use
- I code in Java but I also written programs in Python, Node.js, Javascript, C++ at some point in history, and now I'm learning Go on the side. *example code: [https://github.com/prajyotkcsu/leetcode-solutions]*
- I'm a Spring Boot neard, it's a Java-based web framework. *example code: [https://github.com/prajyotkcsu/remind-gpt]* 
- REST API, GraphQL, and gRPC protocol to build APIs and expose backend services.
- Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, Harness, GitLab as part of deployment strategies.
- Kafka, Flink, Spark, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch for processing, searching, and streaming data.
- AWS cloud and it's most 

### Education
- M.S.; Business Analytics; California State University, East Bay (May 2023)
- B.S.; Information Technology; Mumbai University (May 2017)

### Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Dish Network (March 2024 - Present)**
*I’m a developer on this epic team called ‘Events’  that handles communication on behalf of other teams. This involves receiving close to 10 million events and notifications in a single day and routing them to their respective targets.*
- Our pipeline uses AWS Lambda and EventBridge to ensure high throughput and minimal latency, allowing us to process and deliver events in near real-time.
- Handling 10 million daily events requires robust scaling strategies, and we store data on AWS DynamoDB and use custom partitioning to manage load distribution.
- In certain scenarios, we needed to delay the delivery of events by varying intervals—15, 25, or even 45 minutes. To address this, we developed an endpoint that accepts a customizable delay value and leveraged AWS Scheduled Events to precisely manage these delays.


**Software Engineer @ Financial Software & Systems (March 2018 - March 2021)**
- Built numerous features for a data platform that routes over 1M events daily, including mechanisms such as retry, replay, incident creation, and delay management, using Java Spring Boot and AWS Lambdas.
- Enhanced platform storage by introducing AWS DynamoDB, enabling high query volumes and supporting key features like automatic archival and Capture Data Change with DynamoDB Streams.
- Engineered Apache Kafka infrastructure and servers to stream messages from various sources with 12% reduced cost.
- Improved developer experience by 35 % with gRPC, GraphQL APIs to expose backend databases, enhancing API reusability and speeding up preference retrieval with Redis caching.
