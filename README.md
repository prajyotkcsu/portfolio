### Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Dish Network (March 2024 - Present)**
I'm a developer on the 'Events' team and we handle communication between other teams by receiving and routing events. Below are some of the crucial features that I built over the past 7 months.
- Provided platform to delay notification by creating programmable schedulers in AWS Schedule. This way now teams can send events to us and we ensure that they reach their targets only after a specified time has passed.
- 
- Built numerous features for a data platform that routes over 1M events daily, including mechanisms such as retry, replay, incident creation, and delay management, using Java Spring Boot and AWS Lambdas.
- Enhanced platform storage by introducing AWS DynamoDB, enabling high query volumes and supporting key features like automatic archival and Capture Data Change with DynamoDB Streams.
- Engineered Apache Kafka infrastructure and servers to stream messages from various sources with 12% reduced cost.
- Improved developer experience by 35 % with gRPC, GraphQL APIs to expose backend databases, enhancing API reusability and speeding up preference retrieval with Redis caching.
